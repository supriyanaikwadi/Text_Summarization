# Text Summarization

This project implements Abstractive Text Summarization using TensorFlow for deep learning and Flask for serving the model as a web application.  
It allows users to input long-form text and receive concise, meaningful summaries generated by a trained neural model.  
The app also supports saving summaries in a local memory (database) for later retrieval.

## Features

- Abstractive text summarization using TensorFlow models  
- Flask-based web interface for easy interaction  
- Automatic text preprocessing and summary generation  
- Saves generated summaries for future access  
- Simple and lightweight structure for quick deployment

## Installation

1. **Clone or extract this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Text_Summarization.git
   cd Text_Summarization
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize the database (for saving summaries)**
   ```bash
   python create_db.py
   ```

5. **Run the Flask application**
   ```bash
   python App.py
   ```

6. **Open your browser and visit**
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## How It Works

1. **User Input:**  
   The user enters a paragraph or article into the web interface.

2. **Text Processing:**  
   The input is tokenized, cleaned, and passed through a trained TensorFlow Seq2Seq model.

3. **Model Prediction:**  
   The model generates an abstractive summary of the text.

4. **Memory Saving:**  
   Each User is stored using the local database (via `create_db.py`) for easy retrieval.

## Example

**Input Text:**
> Artificial Intelligence is a rapidly growing field that impacts multiple industries including healthcare, education, and finance.

**Generated Summary:**
> AI is transforming industries like healthcare and finance.
